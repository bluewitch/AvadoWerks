## Astar Polkadot; Shiden Kusama
This document is for Sota's work on building from Substrate and interoperations
with Ethereum Virtual Machine **EVM** and Web Assembler **WASM**

This is important for the operations between Solidity and Substrate, since 
Solidity compiles to **EVM** and Substrate compiles to **WASM**
