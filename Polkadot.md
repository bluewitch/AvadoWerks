## Astar, SmartContracts
Astar (previously Plasm) is a Substrate Runtime Module Library which allows developers to add Plasma functions to their Substrate chain. By adding a Astar (previously Plasm) Substrate Runtime Module Library, you can get scalable blockchains within a few minutes. Some people might not know Substrate Runtime Module Library. Basically speaking, Substrate consists of 2 components, Substrate Core and Substrate Runtime Module Library aka SRML. We can customize Substrate Core with SRML and make an original Substrate chain. Other people might not know Plasma. Plasma is a layer2 scaling solution which makes it possible for scalable computation by structuring economic incentives to operate the blockchain autonomously without the operator’s management. Ideally, it brings infinite scalability into your blockchain.

## Acala, DeFi
Acala is the all-in-one DeFi hub of Polkadot. Acala is an Ethereum-compatible platform for financial applications to use smart contracts or built-in protocols with out-of-the-box cross-chain capabilities and robust security. The platform also offers a suite of financial applications including: a trustless staking derivative (liquid DOT), a multi-collateralized stablecoin backed by cross-chain assets (aUSD), and an AMM DEX – all with micro gas fees that can be paid in any token.

## Centrifuge, DeFi
Centrifuge Chain is the gateway for real-world assets to the Blockchain Multiverse. We built Centrifuge Chain on Parity Substrate with an initial bridge to Ethereum. This allows us to move faster and use a consistent approach for certain features. We envision a larger ecosystem of many, connected blockchains- where Dapps on Ethereum could use data from other chains, value could move freely, and Centrifuge Chain can enable off-chain assets to access financing through DeFi.


## Manta Network, Privacy
Manta Network is the plug-and-play privacy-preservation protocol built to service the entire DeFi stack. Built on Substrate to leverage interoperability and zkSNARKs to leverage scalable privacy, Manta Network offers a suite of products and services that enable privacy for blockchain projects. As part of its own suite of products, Manta Network offers private payment and a private decentralized exchange, MantaSwap. Manta’s founding team comprises many US cryptocurrency veterans, professors, and scholars whose experience include Harvard, MIT, and Algorand. 

## Moonbeam
Moonbeam makes it easy to build decentralized applications on Polkadot — which means your DApps can integrate with other blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. With Moonbeam smart contracts and compatibility with the Ethereum developer toolset, you can quickly build applications that work with users and assets on remote chains, either through native Polkadot compatibility or bridge-based integrations.
