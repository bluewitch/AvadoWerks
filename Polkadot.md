## Astar, SmartContracts
Astar (50% DOT Pool) (previously Plasm) is a Substrate Runtime Module Library which allows developers to add Plasma functions to their Substrate chain. By adding a Astar (previously Plasm) Substrate Runtime Module Library, you can get scalable blockchains within a few minutes. Some people might not know Substrate Runtime Module Library. Basically speaking, Substrate consists of 2 components, Substrate Core and Substrate Runtime Module Library aka SRML. We can customize Substrate Core with SRML and make an original Substrate chain. Other people might not know Plasma. Plasma is a layer2 scaling solution which makes it possible for scalable computation by structuring economic incentives to operate the blockchain autonomously without the operator’s management. Ideally, it brings infinite scalability into your blockchain.

## Manta Network, Privacy 
Manta Network (25% DOT Pool) is the plug-and-play privacy-preservation protocol built to service the entire DeFi stack. Built on Substrate to leverage interoperability and zkSNARKs to leverage scalable privacy, Manta Network offers a suite of products and services that enable privacy for blockchain projects. As part of its own suite of products, Manta Network offers private payment and a private decentralized exchange, MantaSwap. Manta’s founding team comprises many US cryptocurrency veterans, professors, and scholars whose experience include Harvard, MIT, and Algorand. 

## Bit.Country, NFT
Bit.Country (10% DOT Pool) enables everyone to start their own metaverse for their people with the 3D world, NFTs, play-to-earn & build communities to earn, and takes community engagement to a new dimension on web3.0.  A network with an open protocol for managing & incentivizing communities using gamification. Inspired by the decentralization paradigm. Its vision is to allow anyone (especially new users to the blockchain) to create their communities, economies as Bit Country on the blockchain network.  Anyone can start their own metaverse for their fans, followers, members, and fambam! Truly own your community and bring in the power of tokenized economy! Create a virtual world with NFTs for your Telegram group, Wechat group, Twitter followers, Facebook group.

## Acala, DeFi
Acala (5% DOT Pool) is the all-in-one DeFi hub of Polkadot. Acala is an Ethereum-compatible platform for financial applications to use smart contracts or built-in protocols with out-of-the-box cross-chain capabilities and robust security. The platform also offers a suite of financial applications including: a trustless staking derivative (liquid DOT), a multi-collateralized stablecoin backed by cross-chain assets (aUSD), and an AMM DEX – all with micro gas fees that can be paid in any token.

## Centrifuge, DeFi
Centrifuge Chain (5% DOT Pool) is the gateway for real-world assets to the Blockchain Multiverse. We built Centrifuge Chain on Parity Substrate with an initial bridge to Ethereum. This allows us to move faster and use a consistent approach for certain features. We envision a larger ecosystem of many, connected blockchains- where Dapps on Ethereum could use data from other chains, value could move freely, and Centrifuge Chain can enable off-chain assets to access financing through DeFi.

## Moonbeam, SmartContracts
Moonbeam (5% DOT Pool) makes it easy to build decentralized applications on Polkadot — which means your DApps can integrate with other blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. With Moonbeam smart contracts and compatibility with the Ethereum developer toolset, you can quickly build applications that work with users and assets on remote chains, either through native Polkadot compatibility or bridge-based integrations.

## Composable, XCM
Composable’s parachain is going to be able to run multiple bytecodes together in the same place, in order to run smart contracts together in a manner that allows them to communicate and collaborate. As a result, protocols using different smart contract languages (i.e. those on different chains, especially) will be able to unite via our parachain, facilitating cross-chain asset swaps and other functionalities.
