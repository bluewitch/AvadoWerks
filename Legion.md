# TLDR: Don't pay for that shit, the robots do it for free.
Self custody on a decentralized liquidity pool is totally untouchable. Makes sense! They're not monitoring your money, they're monitoring the account with the corporation that you purchase permission to use. If you don't require banking custody with humans, you can use DeFi, and if you need .. If you REALLY ACTUALLY NEED to pay a human or corporation to be responsible with more than $600, well, you should pay for that service and support the business model that suits you. More than $600? More than a day's worth of spendable income on a specific corporatized network? Technologically speaking, that's a waste of energy and labour. Every business can set up a self custody account and be secure with any amount of income on any set of chains. Taxes happen when taxable companies make custody available with taxable labour.
