# Coinomi
---
Coinomi is the oldest multi-chain wallet out there. This wallet has been around since 2014. To date, no Coinomi wallet has ever been hacked or compromised. 

Coinomi supports over 125 blockchains and nearly 1,800 assets. So even the most exotic altcoin dabbler can probably store their coins here. 
ERC-721 NFTs are also supported and so are blockchain domains too. 

The wallet is also packed full of privacy features too. There is **NO KYC** requirement, they donâ€™t save IP addresses, 
there is no identity linking and transactions are not tracked. Coinomi servers also anonymise your requests - no snooping here.

It also has an inbuilt crypto exchange.
