## Wallets for Crypto

Most wallets have the core universal crypto mechinisms, but some
are customized for mobile, exchange mechinisms, etc.

The Avado has its own Wallets for BTC, ETH, etc.  But others 
like metamask can be used, just be mind for they are hot wallets
and should be used for intermitiary travel to wallet destinations

- [Meta Mask](https://metamask.io/), All things being equal is a good starting point, is a hot wallet and funds are online

## Mobile Specific Crypto Wallet

- [Coinomi](https://www.coinomi.com/en/)

## Mobile Wallets
# [Coinomi](https://www.coinomi.com/en/)
Coinomi is the oldest multi-chain wallet out there. This wallet has been around since 2014. To date, no Coinomi wallet has ever been hacked or compromised. 

Coinomi supports over 125 blockchains and nearly 1,800 assets. So even the most exotic altcoin dabbler can probably store their coins here. 
ERC-721 NFTs are also supported and so are blockchain domains too. 

The wallet is also packed full of privacy features too. There is **NO KYC** requirement, they don’t save IP addresses, 
there is no identity linking and transactions are not tracked. Coinomi servers also anonymise your requests - no snooping here.

It also has an inbuilt crypto exchange.

# [Samourai Mobile Wallet](https://samouraiwallet.com/)
For the best stealth, mobile wallet there is Samourai, it was built for security and stealth.  With a feature called invisible mode,
that hides any presence of a wallet, until a recovery pin is entered.

# [Exodus](https://www.exodus.com)
This is the most beautiful crypto wallet I have seen and I doubt you’ll find a better looking one out there. All that makes it super easy 
for you to monitor your portfolio at just a glance and do that crypto dabbling easily. 

Even better, you can secure the app with Face or Touch ID and Exodus encrypts both your private keys and transaction data on your phone.

Over 130 crypto assets are supported.

# [Atomic](https://atomicwallet.io)
Currently my main wallet, trades reasonable in price, and you get a AWS coin token as a reward.  Sells ADA and DOT (but not KSM???), but it
is easy to install and has some nice staking mechinisms, note, the Atomic Wallet goes through a 3rd party exchange named [REDACTED], this 
has had me run into some unwanted diagnostic work during one of my trades to where I discovered this.  DOT was not able to be traded and 
3rd party exchange named [REDACTED] was hving some issues with the network.  I wanted to get my DOTs off so I had to extract the RAW_SEED
 of the DOT wallet on Atomic, and trade from there.
 
 # [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com)
 Trust Wallet supports a staggering 160,000 crypto assets. It also has a fully functioning in-built Web3 browser. This opens up access to a range of different DEX’s and DeFi stuff  useful if that floats your boat.

The wallet also supports ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens. This makes it the perfect choice for NFT collectors. Yes, you can stake cryptos here. However, the selection isn’t as wide as Atomic Wallet. 

Also, Trust Wallet is completely open sourced. This allows anyone to audit the code and leads to higher levels of accountability.
