## Wallets for Crypto

Most wallets have the core universal crypto mechinisms, but some
are customized for mobile, exchange mechinisms, etc.

The Avado has its own Wallets for BTC, ETH, etc.  But others 
like metamask can be used, just be mind for they are hot wallets
and should be used for intermitiary travel to wallet destinations

- [Meta Mask](https://metamask.io/), All things being equal is a good starting point, is a hot wallet and funds are online

- [Coinomi](https://www.coinomi.com/en/)
- [Exodus](https://www.exodus.com)
- [Atomic Wallet](https://atomicwallet.io)
- [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com)


## Mobile Wallets
# Coinomi
Coinomi is the oldest multi-chain wallet out there. This wallet has been around since 2014. To date, no Coinomi wallet has ever been hacked or compromised. 

Coinomi supports over 125 blockchains and nearly 1,800 assets. So even the most exotic altcoin dabbler can probably store their coins here. 
ERC-721 NFTs are also supported and so are blockchain domains too. 

The wallet is also packed full of privacy features too. There is **NO KYC** requirement, they donâ€™t save IP addresses, 
there is no identity linking and transactions are not tracked. Coinomi servers also anonymise your requests - no snooping here.

It also has an inbuilt crypto exchange.

# Samourai Mobile Wallet
For the best stealth, mobile wallet there is Samourai, it was built for security and stealth.  With a feature called invisible mode,
that hides any presence of a wallet, until a recovery pin is entered.

# Exodus

# Atomic
Currently my main wallet, trades reasonable in price, and you get a AWS coin token as a reward.  Sells ADA and DOT (but not KSM???), but it
is easy to install and has some nice staking mechinisms, note, the Atomic Wallet goes through a 3rd party exchange named [REDACTED], this 
has had me run into some unwanted diagnostic work during one of my trades to where I discovered this.  DOT was not able to be traded and 
3rd party exchange named [REDACTED] was hving some issues with the network.  I wanted to get my DOTs off so I had to extract the RAW_SEED
 of the DOT wallet on Atomic, and trade from there.
