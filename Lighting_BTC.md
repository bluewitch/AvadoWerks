# Lighting Network

### Notes
Not only that I can tell you in 10 seconds how to transact instantaneously with Solana for virtually zero fees.
If you want to use the lightning Network you're basically trying to figure out 10 pages of documentation on opening channels, etc. The two aren't even remotely similar.
When it comes to Smart contracts where thousands of transactions per second matter Solana is so far superior.
