[Thing 0](https://ava.do/avado-i7)
All notes on running a Avado Node i7 device.  Setup and links to videos.  The Avado is the metal
 and not an other could 3rd party, This is run on Starlink as the internet service provider (ISP). 
 The idea is to run blockchain nodes Substrate (Kusama/Polkadot), Cardano ADA, and ETH.

## Explain Crypto Staking Like I'm 5

Every coin you hold is like a lottery ticket, when you stake you are giving your tickets to a trusted person (stake pool) who can cash in your winning ticket. He holds others people's tickets as well and as a collective he shares the winnings equally.

More technically speaking when he discovers a winning ticket he uses his computing power to advance the Blockchain i.e. confirms transactions and updates the current ledger and shares this with all the other trusted people who validate his work and this repeats.

## Notes:
phemex, okex, PrimeXBT, kucoin, ftx- (requires level 1 only and thats easy to pass) , Huobi only requires kyc for futures and margin . You can deposit USD directly to kucoin btw . Yes you need a VPN for all fo these except kucoin but honestly I use a VPN for most everything anyhow because I work in tech

Ethereum is just like a metropolis, most projects are built on it since the early days of blockchain. So, you have to pay a high 'toll feeâ€™ when you are using their highway. Try look into alternative network like BSC, Polygon, Dot which are way more cheaper on gas fee.


The SEC maybe out to try and bankrupt select companies to overtake them..... like XRP that had a bid in to be the new Quantum crypto of the United States.
